CS 187 Final Project
This is my final project for Computer Science 187. Intro to Java Programming at NMSU Grants Branch. My program is a simple GUI that could be used by an HR department to request access to computer systems for new employees. The program saves a file to the same directory that the program is stored and it will overwrite the file everytime the form is saved.
